# Essentials-trainer-gen
Generate random trainer encouters data, formatted for Pokémon Essentials v21

## Requirements
You will need Python3 installed on your machine to run the scripts. For the GUI version ```main.py```, you will need to have tkinter installed :

```pip install tkinter```
Other than that, you will obviously need a working version of Pokémon Essentials v21 by Maruno. 

## How to use

You will have a folder with 3 different scripts : ```main.py``` and ```main_cmdline.py```. They both do the same thing, but the former uses a GUI while the latter only uses command line interactions. To launch one or the other, write in the terminal : 

```python main.py``` or ```python main_cmdline.py```

Always keep ```trainer_classes.py``` in the same folder, otherwise it will not work.
